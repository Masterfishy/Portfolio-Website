# Zach Long's Resume Website

Hello, hello! Welcome to my website. This website is intended to highlight key points from my resume to catch your attention! Once I clean up my GitHub, I plan to feature personal projects here too.

For now thanks for visiting and checking out who I am.

#### About the website

This website was built by me. Inspiration for design come from these sources:

- [Brian Design's Tutorial](https://youtu.be/I2UBjN5ER4s)
- [Egator's Tutorial](https://youtu.be/G-Cr00UYokU)
- [Pascal's Portfolio Website](http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/#/profile)
